# ChessAI
Developed a fully functional chess game complete with an AI opponent. The AI calculates its moves using alpha-beta pruning and a minimax algorithm. As the AI considers its possible moves it displays the move it is currently considering by drawing an arrow from the piece it's considering to the end location. The repository also contains a transposition table file that is populated as the game is played. If there is a previously calculated game state stored in the transposition table file then that move will be used without further calculations by the AI. If you would like to start from scratch to fully see the AI's thought process, delete the transposition table file.
