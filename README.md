# ChessAI
Developed a fully functional chess game complete with an AI opponent. The AI calculates its moves using alpha-beta pruning and a minimax algorithm. As the AI considers its possible moves it displays the move it is currently considering by drawing an arrow from the piece it's considering to the end location.
